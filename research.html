        <div class="contentText">
<p>My approach is to develop general ecological theory using mathematical models and then test it empirically. I use stochastic multispecies models of ecological communities in order to make predictions about how environmental processes shape community structure and dynamics. I then test my model predictions in aquatic ecosystems using a variety of empirical methods, including field observations and lab experiments. </p><br />

<div class="contentTitle">Ecological network complexity and predictive certainty</div><br />
          <div class="contentText">
<p>The complexity of ecological networks has long plagued attempts to predict species responses to perturbations. The more speciose and connected the network, the lower the confidence in model predictions, unless accurate estimates of species interaction strengths are known. Low predictive certainty results from the many direct and indirect pathways that contribute to each species overall response to a perturbation. Consequently, most models of community dynamics rely on simplifying assumptions to reduce network complexity and much effort has focused on quantifying interaction strengths. In my current postdoc position with ,<a href="http://people.oregonstate.edu/~novakm/">Mark Novak</a>, we are investigating how allometric relationships between body size, interaction strength, and network topology may constrain sensitivity and improve predictive certainty of complex networks. </p><br />

<p>We simulated allometric trophic networks with topologies varying in species richness and connectance using the niche model. Parameters contributing to interaction strengths (metabolic, ingestion, and production rates) were dependent on species body masses, drawn from empirical distributions of predator/prey body mass ratios. Predictive sensitivity was assessed by systematically varying the uncertainty of interaction strength estimates with respect to the “true” equilibrial responses of each simulated community. </p><br />

<p>We have found that allometrically-constrained networks had considerably improved average predictability over non-constrained networks. Further, and counter-intuitively, complexity (connectance) increased predictability when networks were allometrically constrained. This occurred because the distribution of interaction strengths is key to predictive certainty and is directly influenced by allometry, species richness, and connectivity. As a consequence, having accurate estimates of only the strongest 5% of species interactions dramatically improves predictability, especially for highly speciose and connected networks. We conclude that efforts to predict the response of multispecies communities to perturbations will profit by incorporating allometric scaling, embracing network complexity (i.e. avoiding network simplification), and accurately identifying and estimating the strength of the strongest species interactions in the community (Iles and Novak <i>in prep</i>).

<div class="contentTitle">Effects of environmental temperature on community dynamics</div><br />
          <div class="contentText">
<p>Although temperature is often identified as the main environmental factor defining the distribution of marine species, the mechanisms producing these patterns are not well understood. My Ph.D. research began with a theoretical evaluation of the effects of temperature on community stability, population stability and species persistence in simulated allometric trophic network (ATN) models. The ATN model (built in MATLAB), generates random food web matrices using the 'niche' algorithm and assigns body masses to each species by randomly drawing on a realistic distribution of predator-prey body mass ratios (following Brose et al. 2006). I programmed temperature dependence into the metabolic and ingestion rate parameters based on the methods developed by Vasseur & McCann (2005). I then evaluated the effect of the temperature scaling parameters by running repeated numerical simulations of randomly generated webs at different temperatures. Species persistence in the model webs was greatest when ingestion rates were not as sensitive to temperature as metabolic rates; However, species persistence under this parameter configuration decreased with increasing temperatures (Iles <i>in prep</i>). This pattern of reduced species persistence at higher temperatures has been observed in natural ecosystems and microcosm experiments. Thus, I predicted that ectotherm consumers in natural ecosystems would be likely to exhibit metabolic rates that increase faster with temperature than ingestion rates.</p><br />

<p>Since limited data is available on the temperature dependency of ingestion rates relative to metabolic rates, I tested the theoretical prediction derived from my numerical simulations by empirically quantifying the relative temperature scaling of metabolic and ingestion rates for a suite of rocky intertidal invertebrate consumers. The results support the model predictions; consumer basal metabolic rates do tend to be more sensitive to temperature than ingestion rates. Thus, as temperature increases, metabolic rates tend to increase faster than ingestion rates (Iles <i>in revision</i>).</p><br />

<div class="contentTitle">Predator-prey body size ratios and energy flow through food webs</div><br />
          <div class="contentText">
<p>Most research in aquatic ecosystem toxicology focuses on the direct, physiological effects of pollutants on fish. My master's research demonstrated a mechanism for indirect effects on growth, due to changes in energy flow through a modified food web (Iles and Rasmussen 2005, Rasmussen et al. 2008). As fish grow larger, they tend to shift their diet to larger prey, maintaining a relatively low predator/prey body size ratio. However, lakes with metal-contaminated sediments lack large-bodied invertebrate prey, such as crayfish, forcing juvenile fish to rely on small prey, such as zooplankton. We found that the energetic costs of foraging for many, small prey, ultimately causes stunted growth. Thus, a diverse prey base is essential for maintaining energetically profitable predator/prey body size ratios.</p><br />
<p>     Acknowledging the importance of predator/prey body size ratios, I incorporated body size as a factor when experimentally measuring the temperature effects on rocky intertidal consumer ingestion and metabolic rates. I documented a hump-shaped relationship between predator/prey body size ratios and species interaction strength, indicating constraints at both ends of the spectrum.</p><br />

<div class="contentTitle">Long-term trends in environmental forcing</div><br />
          <div class="contentText">
<p>To predict these community-level impacts, we must also have an understanding of how environmental conditions are changing in the long-term. Coastal upwelling is a natural process in which seasonal weather patterns bring deep, cold, nutrient rich water to the sunlit surface, resulting in highly productive coastal ecosystems. As upwelling is driven by large-scale atmospheric patterns, global climate change has the potential to affect a wide range of significant ecological processes through changes in water chemistry, water temperature, and the transport processes that influence species dispersal and recruitment. In collaboration with <a href="http://people.oregonstate.edu/~gouhiert/index.html">Tarik Gouhier</a> and my advisor, <a href="http://mytilus.science.oregonstate.edu/BAM.html">Bruce Menge</a>, we examined long-term trends in the frequency, duration, and strength of upwelling events for the California Current System along the coast of Oregon and California. We found long-term trends towards stronger and more persistent upwelling events, a pattern which is consistent with climate change predictions (Iles, Gouhier, Menge et al. 2012). We predicted several consequences of these trends, including extended periods of reduced water temperatures and modified recruitment dynamics for near shore ecosystems.</p><br />
<p>     This work has recently led to an exploratory wavelet clustering project in collaboration with <a href="http://www.biologie.ens.fr/~cazelles/bernard/Welcome.html">Bernard Cazelles</a>. Our objective is to quantify pair wise differences in wavelet spectra among intertidal invertebrate recruitment, water temperature, and upwelling time series data to determine if they cluster based on environmental conditions.</p><br />
